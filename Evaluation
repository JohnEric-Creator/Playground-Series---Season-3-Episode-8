Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:

RMSE=√1NN∑i=1(yi−ˆyi)2

where ˆyi is the predicted value and yi is the original value for each instance i.
Submission File

For each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target price. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,price
193573,3969.155
193574,8512.67
193575,1122.34
